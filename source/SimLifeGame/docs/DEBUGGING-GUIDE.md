# üêæ Pet System Debugging Guide

## Problem: "No available pets showing in the pets modal"

I've added debugging features to help identify the issue. Here's how to test:

### Step 1: Open the Game
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Choose a profession and start the game
3. Open browser developer tools (F12)

### Step 2: Test Pet Loading
In the browser console, type:
```javascript
testPetLoading()
```

This will show:
- ‚úÖ If game object exists
- ‚úÖ If game has started
- ‚úÖ How many pets were loaded
- ‚úÖ Names of first 5 pets
- ‚úÖ Sample pet data

### Step 3: Check Pet Modal
1. Click the üêæ Pets button in the action controls
2. Check the console for debug messages:
   - "Opening pets modal..."
   - "Game pets loaded: X"
   - "Available pets: [object]"
   - "Number of pets loaded: X"

### Step 4: Alternative Pet Test
Open `pet-test.html` in your browser and click "Test Pet Loading" to verify pets.xml loads correctly.

## Expected Results

**If working correctly:**
- Console should show "Loaded 23 pets"
- testPetLoading() should return 23 pets
- Pets modal should show available pets with buy buttons

**If pets aren't loading:**
- Check console for error messages
- Verify pets.xml is in the same directory as index.html
- Check network tab for failed requests

## Quick Fixes

**If pets show "Loading pets..." message:**
- Click the "Refresh" button in the modal
- Wait a few seconds for async loading
- Check console for fetch errors

**If no pets at all:**
- Verify pets.xml file exists and is valid
- Check browser console for error messages
- Try opening pet-test.html first

## Debug Console Commands

```javascript
// Check if pets loaded
testPetLoading()

// Check game state
console.log(game.gameState)

// Check pet data structure
console.log(game.pets.goldfish)

// Manually refresh pets modal
updatePetsModal()
```

Let me know what the console shows and I can help fix any issues!
